    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Persian rice with golden potatoes and saffron takes the grand prize.
      I believe I've posted a few foolproof methods for cooking perfect rice,
      but the beauty of this method is that it doesn't rely on any specific
      measurements or exact times. This will make some of you very nervous but
      just go with it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 russet potato, cut into ¼-inch slices</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, cut into thin slices, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons hot water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil. Add rice; cook
        and stir for exactly 7 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover bottom of the pot
        with 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over potatoes.
        Cook until potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with rice
        to form an even layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over
        rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, then place the lid over
        the towels. Steam until rice is fluffy, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix crushed saffron with
        1 ½ tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of spoonfuls of
        rice to saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line
        the edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
